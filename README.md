Hey, here is Wei Zheng. I am a dedicated person with a family of three. 
Iâ€™m not always the extroverted one, but I have always spent my time with my friends.
People find me humorous once we get along with each other. 
I have a strong passion for math and science, it is like solving a puzzle, 
you face it and you solve it, and it is also the reason why I join SEP because I love problem-solving.
